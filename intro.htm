      <p>Aloha! It is my pleasure to meet you via my website that I created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript which I learned through Distance Education(eLearning). I am a life-long advocator of eLearning education, dedicated to making a variety of knowledge available to anyone and customizing learning experiences to each student.</p>
      <p>It was a turning point for me to pursue higher education in master's program majoring in Learning Design and Technology at the University of Hawaii.</p>
      <p><img src="images/Mnemonic1.gif" alt="Korean Consonant" style="width:300px; height:200; float:right;"/>As a Korean instructor, distance Learning opens the door to a whole new world of teaching methods. The right image shows how to memorize a Korean consonant using GIF mnemomnic which does not require a conversative learning setting in person.</p>
      <p>The second GIF shows step-by-step process of Korean conjugation<img src="images/Mnemonic2.gif" alt="Korean Conjugation" style="width:300px; height:200px; float:left;"/>
      <p>when I was introduced to Massive Open Online Learning Courses<a href="http://mooc.org/">(MOOC)</a>, I have explored many options to the online interactive learning activities.</p>
      <p>As the biggest beneficiary of Distance Learning, it is my mission to introduce eLearning to avid learners who seek learning opportunities. I would like to make another opportunity to learn for you. </p>
